This polynomal code will allow you to fin the root solver for any quadric formula 
the program first asks you to enter your three inputs in order from x^2+bx+c
it saves the inputs as a,b,c 
once that is done it then divids your b/a and saves it as "d" then c/a then saves it as "e"
 after that is it uses another two codes 
 (-d + square root (d^2-4E))/2 and saves it for F
 (-d - square root (d^2-4E))/2 and saves it for F
 later f is made negative and saved as h 
 g is also made negative and saved as i
 after the a(x+b)(x+c) is used to give out the final outputs as A,B,C
